# ZINARA Vehicle Licensing Dataset - Column Descriptions

## Overview
This dataset contains vehicle licensing information from the Zimbabwe National Road Administration (ZINARA) system. The data is used to predict vehicle license compliance patterns and identify vehicles at high risk of being unlicensed. The dataset spans multiple years (2015-2024) and covers various regions across Zimbabwe.

## Data Collection Methodology
- **Source**: ZINARA licensing database
- **Time Period**: 2015-2024 (9 years of data)
- **Geographic Coverage**: All provinces in Zimbabwe (urban, peri-urban, rural areas)
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time data synchronization from agent terminals and online platforms

## Column Descriptions

### 1. vehicle_id (String/Integer)

### 3. registration_date (Date)
**Description**: Date when the vehicle was first registered with ZINARA
**Data Type**: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Relevance**: Determines vehicle age and historical compliance patterns
**Business Impact**: Older vehicles may have different renewal behaviors than newer ones
**Validation**: Must be before current date

### 4. region (String - Categorical)
**Description**: Geographic region where the vehicle is primarily operated
**Data Type**: String
**Categories**:
- urban: Major cities (Harare, Bulawayo)
- peri_urban: Suburban areas around major cities
- rural: Rural districts and farming areas
**Relevance**: Regional differences affect access to licensing services and enforcement
**Business Impact**: Rural areas have lower compliance rates due to limited agent access

### 5. last_license_renewal (Date)
**Description**: Date of the most recent license renewal payment
**Data Type**: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Relevance**: Key indicator of current licensing status
**Business Impact**: Vehicles with very old renewal dates are likely unlicensed
**Validation**: Must be before or equal to current date

### 6. is_licensed (Boolean)
**Description**: Current licensing status (True = licensed, False = unlicensed)
**Data Type**: Boolean
**Relevance**: Target variable for compliance prediction models
**Business Impact**: Primary metric for measuring compliance rates
**Distribution**: Expected to be imbalanced (70-80% licensed, 20-30% unlicensed)

### 7. license_expiry_date (Date)
**Description**: Date when the current license expires
**Data Type**: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Relevance**: Determines if license is currently valid
**Business Impact**: Vehicles with expired licenses are non-compliant
**Calculation**: Usually last_renewal_date + 1 year

### 8. payment_mode (String - Categorical)
**Description**: Method used for license renewal payments
**Data Type**: String
**Categories**:
- online: Direct online payments through ZINARA portal

## Data Quality Considerations

### Missing Values Strategy
- **online_platform_last_login**: Expected missing for non-online payments
- **agent_sync_delay**: Set to 0 for non-agent payments
- **Dates**: Converted to datetime, invalid dates become NaT
- **Numeric fields**: Filled with median values where appropriate

### Outlier Handling
- **IQR Method**: Used for most numeric columns
- **Business Logic**: Preserved for payment modes and regional data
- **Date Validation**: Impossible dates removed

### Data Integrity Rules
1. late_renewals_count ≤ total_renewals
2. registration_date ≤ current_date
3. last_license_renewal ≤ current_date
4. license_expiry_date ≥ last_license_renewal
5. agent_sync_delay = 0 for non-agent payments

## Business Rules and Constraints

### Licensing Logic
- Licenses are valid for 1 year from renewal date
- Renewals can be made up to 6 months after expiry (grace period)
- Vehicles over 6 months expired are considered non-compliant

### Payment Processing
- Online payments processed immediately
- Mobile money payments confirmed within 24 hours
- Agent payments may have synchronization delays
- Cash payments require manual processing

### Regional Considerations
- Urban areas: High enforcement, easy access to services
- Peri-urban: Moderate enforcement, variable access
- Rural areas: Limited enforcement, few agent locations

## Model Target Definition

### Compliance Status (is_licensed)
- **True (Compliant)**: License renewed within last 12 months
- **False (Non-compliant)**: No renewal in last 12 months
- **Edge Cases**: Vehicles in grace period (6 months expired) may be considered compliant

### Risk Scoring
- **Low Risk**: Recently renewed, good payment history
- **Medium Risk**: Moderate renewal delays, mixed history
- **High Risk**: Long overdue, poor compliance history

## Usage in Machine Learning Models

### Feature Selection Strategy
1. **Time-based features**: days_since_renewal, vehicle_age_years
2. **Behavioral features**: renewal_frequency, late_renewal_rate, compliance_score
3. **Digital adoption**: payment_digital_score, agent_efficiency
4. **Geographic factors**: region_risk_score, regional compliance rates
5. **Interaction features**: age_region_risk, payment_region_mismatch

### Target Engineering
- **Binary Classification**: Predict current compliance status
- **Risk Scoring**: Continuous probability of being unlicensed
- **Multi-class**: Low/Medium/High risk categories

### Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary**: F1-Score (balances precision and recall for imbalanced data)
- **Secondary**: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall
- **Business**: Compliance rate improvement, false positive reduction

## Data Update Frequency
- **Real-time**: Online payments and mobile money transactions
- **Daily**: Agent terminal synchronizations
- **Weekly**: Batch updates from rural areas
- **Monthly**: Historical data reconciliation

## Privacy and Security Considerations
- **Anonymization**: Vehicle IDs are hashed for external analysis
- **PII Protection**: Owner information not included in analytical datasets
- **Access Control**: Data access restricted by role and clearance level
- **Audit Trail**: All data access logged for compliance monitoring

## Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Features**: Vehicle value, engine size, usage patterns
2. **External Data**: Economic indicators, fuel prices, weather data
3. **Real-time Features**: GPS tracking, payment attempt logs
4. **Behavioral Features**: Login frequency, portal usage patterns
